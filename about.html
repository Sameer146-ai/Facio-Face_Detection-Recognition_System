          The <strong>Face and Image Detection App</strong> is an advanced tool
          that allows users to upload an image and detect faces within it. The
          app can analyze the uploaded image, recognize faces, and determine
          whether the detected face belongs to a celebrity. If a celebrity is
          recognized, the app provides additional information and a brief
          description of the person.
